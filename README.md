# pdb2oniom

A python implementation of pdb2oniom for QM/MM (ONIOM) calculations.

An alternative of `pdb2oniom` perl script originally developed at [TAO package](http://schlegelgroup.wayne.edu/Software/oniomtoolTAO/TAOtutorial.html). The feature to import force field parameters from an input parm7 file is inspired by the [CATs package](https://github.com/kulhanek/cats) and its `topcrd2mmcom` command.

## Feature

- Generate a Gaussian input file for ONIOM calculations from AMBER topology (`.parm7`) and restart (`.rst7`) files.
- The force field parameters in the AMBER topology file will be written in the output gjf file automatically.

## Installation

```bash
# install from GitHub
python3.11 -m pip install git+https://github.com/BILAB/pdb2oniom.git
# upgrade
python3.11 -m pip uninstall pdb2oniom -y && python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/BILAB/pdb2oniom.git
```

## Usage

An example to run:

```bash
$ pdb2oniom_py -p leap.parm7 -r leap.rst7 --resid corelist.txt -n 7
